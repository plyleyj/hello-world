# hello-world
my first repository

This is my very first github creation! My name is Jon Plyley, I have a M.S. in Applied Math and a B.S. in Industrial Math and Stats. I know C++, Java, and Python. I'm currently learning R and SQL. I want to be a Data Scientist and am learning more about Machine Learning.
